This project presents a Deep Learning model based on VGG16 architecture. Presence or absence of Brain tumor is detected in the given real time MRI images. VGG16 architecture that is 16 layers deep is used for the detection of tumor. The model is trained on the dataset containing images of cells with and without tumor.The input to the network is an image of dimensions (224, 224, 3). The model built in this project is basically a pre-trained model.
The steps involved are

1.Importing necessary libraries

2.Preprocessing of data

3.Splitting the data into train and test data

4.Building the model 

5.Fitting the model

6.Evaluation of model

The validation accuracy of the model ranges from 88.5%-99.9%. Model is finally tested on different images.The dataset for this project has been taken from public repository kaggle.
