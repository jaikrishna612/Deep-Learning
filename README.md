This repository contains the codes of models of Deep Learning based projects.
The steps involved are

1.Importing necessary libraries

2.Preprocessing of data

3.Splitting the data into train and test data

4.Building the model 

5.Fitting the model

6.Evaluation of model

The validation accuracy of the model ranges from 88.5%-99.9%. Model is finally tested on different images.The dataset for this project has been taken from public repository kaggle.
